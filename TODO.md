- need to figure out data backup/restore workflow
  - containers
  - homedir data (specific path? mostly for notes, etc)
  - mountpoint that doesn't persist by default (e.g. ~/Downloads)
- consider breaking out roles into their own repos and publishing them on galaxy
- dyindude.user role to provide variables for these roles, include a dependency
- apt/package role to provide handlers for updating package cache, dist-upgrade, etc
- workflow changes
  - "common" should not have any of its own tasks. define dependencies here on other roles
    - this is kind of a fallacy, creates a needless role and puts source of truth deep in
      the project tree. planning to put the role list either in playbook.yml or in vars/main.yml
  - maybe even define the dependencies in vars/main.yml?
    - I want one place to look, that makes sense, for the overall configuration
  - need to add tags
    - to that end, need to separate 'config/update' plays from 'provision'
- bugs??
  - steam wouldn't launch on last install due to this bug:
    - https://askubuntu.com/questions/771032/steam-not-opening-in-ubuntu-16-04-lts/771507
    - may need to look out for what edge cases cause this
  - lost my changes for deb-steam, need to fork/replace the module anyway
  - variable precedence with vars/main.yml and the role
    - vars/main.yml overrides role defaults (this is what we want)
    - vars/secret.yml overrides vars/main.yml (as long as we include it last)
  - want to be able to define all important vars in vars/
- build the entire damn thing on
  - gentoo
  - centos
  - fedora
  - arch
  - debian
  - freebsd (steam may be a problem here)
  - this will require testing each role on other distros
- #role dependencies
  - for my current roles, this is a little situational. still need to understand when defining role deps makes sense
- copy rc.lua to VAR USER (part of dotfiles?)
- look into messing around with zsh as default shell in linux. it's bearable in Windows
- roles to add (check galaxy?)
  - #steam (repo + packages) (used galaxy package)
  - #obs (repo + packages)
  - calibre
  - golang
  - node
  - docker chrome
  - mplayer
  - minidlna
- dotfiles repo
  - tmux
  - awesome
  - vim
  - .bash_profile/bashrc
  - todoist?
  - python - ~/.py
  - manage ~/.bin
- QOL
  - font-management
    - fc-cache as my user?
  - term background scripts

- stuff to mess around with later:
  - when making changes to apt-repository definitions, the old ones seem to hang out and break stuff.
    this seems to go against the idea of idempotency. Need to figure out how people usually manage this
    (spoilers: probably by testing it in vagrant first like I'm already doing)
