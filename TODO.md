- need to figure out data backup/restore workflow
  - containers
  - homedir data (specific path? mostly for notes, etc)
  - mountpoint that doesn't persist by default (e.g. ~/Downloads)
- consider breaking out roles into their own repos and publishing them on galaxy
- dyindude.user role to provide variables for these roles, include a dependency
- workflow changes
- bugs??
  - steam wouldn't launch on last install due to this bug:
    - https://askubuntu.com/questions/771032/steam-not-opening-in-ubuntu-16-04-lts/771507
    - may need to look out for what edge cases cause this
  - want to be able to define all important vars in vars/
- copy rc.lua to VAR USER (part of dotfiles?)
- roles to add (check galaxy?)
  - calibre
  - golang
  - node
  - docker chrome
  - mplayer
  - minidlna
- dotfiles repo
  - awesome
  - .bash_profile/bashrc
  - todoist?
  - python - ~/.py
  - manage ~/.bin
- QOL
  - font-management
    - fc-cache as my user?
  - term background scripts
