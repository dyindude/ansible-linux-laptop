- workflow changes
  - "common" should not have any of its own tasks. define dependencies here on other roles
  - maybe even define the dependencies in vars/main.yml?
    - I want one place to look, that makes sense, for the overall configuration
- bugs??
  - variable precedence with vars/main.yml and the role
  - want to be able to define all important vars in vars/
- build the entire damn thing on
  - gentoo
  - centos
  - fedora
  - arch
  - debian
  - freebsd (steam may be a problem here)
- #role dependencies
  - sorta done, not sure that I'm really getting a huge benefit - tho i do see the benefit in making docker
    container tasks depend on the docker tasks
- copy rc.lua to VAR USER (part of dotfiles?)
- look into messing around with zsh as default shell in linux. it's bearable in Windows
- roles to add (check galaxy?)
  - #steam (repo + packages) (used galaxy package)
  - #obs (repo + packages)
  - calibre
  - golang
  - node
  - docker chrome
  - mplayer
  - minidlna
- dotfiles repo
  - tmux
  - awesome
  - vim
  - .bash_profile/bashrc
  - todoist?
  - python - ~/.py
  - manage ~/.bin
- QOL
  - font-management
    - fc-cache as my user?
  - term background scripts

- stuff to mess around with later:
  - when making changes to apt-repository definitions, the old ones seem to hang out and break stuff.
    this seems to go against the idea of idempotency. Need to figure out how people usually manage this
    (spoilers: probably by testing it in vagrant first like I'm already doing)
